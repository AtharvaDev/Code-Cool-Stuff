When you send a link on twitter or social media you get a preview.
Facebook launched Open Graph protocol in 2010. it is using that protocol that most social networks can displaay the preview of your website.
Website previews help you reach a broader audience. Without them most websites won't display anything but the link url, some might try to auto fill it.
Attention to detail will separate you from everyone else. Make good use of this!
